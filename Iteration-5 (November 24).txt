============= 
Retrospective 5 11-24-12 
------------------------------------------------- 
Previous Iteration Goals 
* Be more proactive in communicating with the user on requirements: We sent some screenshots of the application's progress to the user. She seems pleased with what we've done so far. 
* More detail with stories: We've established clear expectations for the stories
* Learn how to implement REST: While not a true RESTful implementation, we implemented a way for Android to communicate with the database. 

Things you did wrong: 
* We waited too long to communicate with the user -- Matt
* Didn't give the user a working prototype to the user -- Sam

Things you did right: 
* Gave the user screen shots of the application -- Jeff
* Communicated well with each other -- Branden
* We were proactive on starting out stories -- Jordan
* Kept the code clean. Didn't have any conflicts -- Tim


Goals for next Iteration: 
* Work together to prepare a presentation for the project 
* Communicate with the user early in the iteration so any last-minute requests can be fulfilled

Dede,

Hope all is well. We wanted to send to you some screen shots of the application to this point. We have made some real progress and we hope you like what we have so far.
Attahced you will find several screen shots. Please do not hesitate to let us know of anything you do not like or would like to change. We still have the following to implement:

1. The Android app
2. Functionality to add multiple users
3. Display the user that created the transaction (Deposit/Expense)
4. Some additional functionality that the end user will not see

Please let us know if any of your requirements have changed or if we missed something above.

Thank you, 
Team Apathy
