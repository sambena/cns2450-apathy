Team Assignment: Iteration

Objectives:

The purpose of an iteration is to allow you to analyze your progress and refocus your efforts to help you achieve greater success. Below is the items that you should become familiar with through iterations.

1. What tasks have you completed

2. Have your priorities shifted (e.g. any requirement changes)

3. Has everyone been able to put in equal effort

4. What are some issues or bottlenecks in your way

Iterations also allow for you to use retrospectives to help the team collaboratively grow and morph the process to better suit the team. In retrospectives you will need to share ideas that fall into one of the three categories

1. What we did wrong

2. What we did right

3. What we want to try to do
