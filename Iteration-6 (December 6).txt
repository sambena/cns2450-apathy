Dede,

We have deployed our latest code to a live server so you can play around with the application. When you have a moment, please take a look and let us know what you think. If there is anything you want changed, we will do our best to accommodate your requests before the end of the semester. We are in process of testing and cleaning up any defects, so we apologize in advance if you encounter any unsightly errors. :)

You can access the application by going to http://apathy.mptolman.net.


Thanks!
